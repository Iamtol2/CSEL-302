# Computer Science Course
A computer science course covers fundamental topics such as programming, algorithms, data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, software engineering, databases, artificial intelligence, networking, and security. Students learn to program, analyze algorithms, understand computer systems, design software, work with data, explore AI concepts, and grasp networking and security principles. The course combines theory with hands-on projects and practical applications to prepare students for careers in various technology fields.

# CSEL-203 Subject
CSEL 302 delves into the realm of Artificial Intelligence (AI), focusing on advanced concepts and techniques within this field. Students can expect to explore topics such as machine learning algorithms, neural networks, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, reinforcement learning, and the ethical considerations surrounding AI technologies. Through a combination of theoretical understanding and hands-on projects, students will develop the skills needed to apply AI techniques in various domains and prepare for roles in AI research, development, and implementation.
